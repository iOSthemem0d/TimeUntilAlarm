# TimeUntilAlarm
by Ludvig Eriksson

TimeUntilAlarm is a jailbreak tweak that shows the time remaining until the alarms go off.
As of version 1.1.0 it can also show the time until the next active alarm on the lock screen.

It is available for free from [BigBoss](http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=timeuntilalarmDp)
